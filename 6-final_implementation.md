# Implementation plan

## Phase 1: Environment Setup

1.  Clone the CodeGuide Starter Pro repository from <https://github.com/codeguide-dev/codeguide-starter-pro> to serve as
    the base for the project (Project Overview: Core Features; Starter Kit).
2.  Create a new repository named `braindump` using the cloned starter kit as the template (Starter Kit: CodeGuide
    Starter Pro).
3.  Ensure Node.js v20.2.1 is installed by running `node -v` and install it if missing (Tech Stack: Core Tools).
4.  Validate that TypeScript is set up in the project by checking the presence of a `tsconfig.json` file in the root
    directory (Tech Stack: Frontend).
5.  Create a new branch named `development` for ongoing development (Project Workflow: Version Control).

## Phase 2: Frontend Development

1.  Install Next.js version 14 (explicitly) as the framework; note that Next.js 14 is required for optimal integration
    with current AI coding tools (Tech Stack: Frontend).
2.  Configure Tailwind CSS by installing its package and adding the configuration file at `/tailwind.config.js` (Tech
    Stack: Frontend).
3.  Install Shadcn UI components by following the official integration guide and placing configurations in
    `/components/shadcn.config.ts` (Tech Stack: Frontend).
4.  Set up Typescript types by ensuring that all React components are written in `.tsx` files (Tech Stack: Frontend).
5.  Create the landing page `/pages/index.tsx` to welcome users with a calming, minimalist design using light blue,
    green, and lavender tones (Project Overview: Design & Branding).
6.  Develop the onboarding and authentication page `/pages/auth.tsx` that integrates Clerk for Google sign-in; include
    necessary Clerk components as directed in Clerk documentation (App Flow: Onboarding and Authentication; Authentication:
    Clerk).
7.  **Validation:** Run `npm run dev` and check that the landing and authentication pages load correctly in a web
    browser.
8.  Create the Home Dashboard page `/pages/dashboard.tsx` which will display recent journal entries, upcoming to-dos, and
    navigation links (App Flow: Home Dashboard and Navigation).
9.  Build the Journal Entry page `/pages/journal.tsx` to allow users to create entries via text input and voice-to-text
    integration (App Flow: Journal Entry Creation and Voice-to-Text).
10. Integrate a Voice-to-Text UI component by creating `/components/VoiceInput.tsx` that will later trigger calls to the
    Deepgram API (Core Feature: Voice-to-Text Journaling).
11. Develop an AI Insights page `/pages/insights.tsx` where AI-generated insights, to-dos, and reflections are displayed
    and can be manually edited (Core Feature: AI-Powered Insights & Reflections; App Flow: AI-Powered Insights and
    Customization).
12. Implement the Focus Mode page `/pages/focus.tsx` with a customizable timer, break reminders, and distraction blocker
    controls (Core Feature: Focus Mode with To-Do Integration; App Flow: Focus Mode and Deep Work Sessions).
13. Create the Daily Review page `/pages/daily-review.tsx` that summarizes the day's journal entries and completed to-dos
    (Core Feature: Daily Review Summary; App Flow: Daily Review and Reflection).
14. Develop the Weekly Productivity Report page `/pages/weekly-report.tsx` which compiles insights and displays
    integration options for external calendars and task managers (Core Feature: Weekly Productivity Report; App Flow: Weekly
    Productivity Recap and Integration).
15. **Validation:** Run `npm run build` and verify there are no errors while compiling the frontend code.

## Phase 3: Backend Development

1.  Initialize Supabase integration by configuring the Supabase client in `/lib/supabaseClient.ts` using the project URL
    and public API key provided in the Supabase dashboard (Tech Stack: Backend).
2.  Define Supabase database schemas/tables for journal entries, AI insights, to-dos, and focus mode session data by
    running the provided SQL scripts (Backend: Supabase Schema Setup).
3.  Set up API route `/pages/api/v1/voice-to-text` that will proxy requests to the Deepgram API for voice
    transcription (Core Feature: Voice-to-Text Journaling; APIs: Deepgram API).
4.  Create API route `/pages/api/v1/ai-insights` that accepts journal text submissions and returns AI-generated
    insights using the OpenAI GPT-4o API (Core Feature: AI-Powered Insights & Reflections; APIs: OpenAI API).
5.  Ensure that authentication is enforced in API routes by verifying Clerk session tokens within each endpoint (Data
    Privacy: Clerk; App Flow: Onboarding).
6.  **Validation:** Test the `/api/v1/voice-to-text` endpoint locally using Postman or `curl` to verify a successful
    proxy response from Deepgram.
7.  **Validation:** Test the `/api/v1/ai-insights` endpoint with sample data to receive a response from the OpenAI API,
    verifying proper integration.

## Phase 4: Integration

1.  In the Journal Entry page (`/pages/journal.tsx`), integrate the frontend VoiceInput component to call the
    `/api/v1/voice-to-text` endpoint using `fetch` or axios (Integration: Frontend to Backend Connectivity).
2.  In the AI Insights page (`/pages/insights.tsx`), integrate a form that calls the `/api/v1/ai-insights` endpoint and
    displays results; allow manual edits post-generation (Integration: API & Manual Editing; Core Feature: Manual Editing).
3.  Configure Clerk authentication middleware on both frontend and backend to manage user session states, ensuring only
    authenticated users can access sensitive pages (Integration: Data Privacy; Authentication: Clerk).
4.  Connect the Home Dashboard with Supabase to fetch recent journal entries and upcoming to-dos by creating a client
    component and can be manually edited (Core Feature: AI-Powered Insights & Reflections; App Flow: AI-Powered Insights
    and Customization).
5.  Integrate third-party services (Google Calendar, Trello, Outlook, etc.) by creating separate API endpoints in
    `/pages/api/v1/integrations/*` for each service; these endpoints handle data sync and exporting options as needed (App
    Flow: Weekly Productivity Recap and Integration).
6.  **Validation:** Run end-to-end tests on local endpoints using sample data to ensure proper data flow between the
    frontend, Supabase backend, and third-party integration endpoints.

## Phase 5: Deployment

1.  Configure environment variables for production including Supabase keys, Clerk configuration, Deepgram API keys, and
    OpenAI API keys in a `.env.production` file at the root (Security: Environment Setup).
2.  Set up a production build by running `npm run build` and verifying that all environment-specific configurations load
    correctly (Deployment: Build Process).
3.  Deploy the Next.js application to Vercel (or your chosen cloud provider) ensuring that Next.js 14 is maintained;
    follow Vercel's deployment guide and use the provided configuration settings (Deployment: Cloud Setup).
4.  Set up Supabase in production by ensuring the correct database URL and API keys are configured; verify connectivity
    from the deployed app (Deployment: Database Integration).
5.  Connect Clerk to the production environment by updating API keys and callback URLs in the Clerk dashboard
    (Deployment: Authentication Setup).
6.  Enable HTTPS and configure a CDN if necessary (e.g., via Vercel's built-in CDN) for fast load times globally
    (Deployment: Performance Optimization).
7.  **Validation:** Perform smoke tests on production endpoints (e.g., voice-to-text and AI insights) via deployed URLs
    ensuring all features work as expected.

## Final Validations and Testing

1.  Run a full integration test of the application by simulating a user journey from authentication, journal entry
    creation (voice and text), AI insights generation, and focus mode session (Testing: End-to-End Test).
2.  Conduct manual UI/UX testing to ensure that the calming, minimalist design is applied consistently across all pages
    (Testing: UI/UX).
3.  Validate the manual editing capabilities on the AI insights page to ensure users can update and save changes
    (Testing: Functionality).
4.  Test third-party integrations by syncing a sample event with Google Calendar and verifying the update reflects in the
    Weekly Productivity Report (Testing: Integration).
5.  Monitor logs in both Vercel and Supabase for any runtime errors after deployment (Testing: Error Monitoring).

## Post-Deployment and Monitoring

1.  Set up error tracking (e.g., Sentry) by installing the Sentry package and initializing it in `/lib/sentry.ts` to
    capture frontend and backend errors (Maintenance: Error Tracking).
2.  Configure performance monitoring on Vercel dashboards and Supabase to track API performance and database query times
    (Maintenance: Performance Monitoring).
3.  Schedule regular test runs using Cypress for end-to-end tests and integrate them into the CI/CD pipeline (Deployment:
    CI/CD Integration).
4.  Document the API endpoints and integration flows in a README section under `/docs/API.md` for future reference and
    team onboarding (Documentation: Developer Guide).
5.  Announce the deployment and notify the relevant stakeholders with usage instructions and known limitations
    (Communication: Project Overview).
