# Backend Structure Document

This document outlines the backend structure for Braindump, an AI-powered journaling and productivity web application.
The following sections detail the backend architecture, database management, API design, hosting, infrastructure
components, security measures, monitoring and maintenance practices, and an overall summary.

## 1. Backend Architecture

The backend of Braindump is designed to support scalability, maintainability, and optimal performance. Key elements
include:

*   **Modular Design:** The system is divided into components such as voice-to-text processing, AI insights generation,
    journaling management, and third-party integrations. Each component is loosely coupled to ensure ease of updates and
    maintenance.
*   **Frameworks & Services:**
    *   **Supabase:** Serves as the primary database and authentication management system.
    *   **Clerk Auth:** Provides user authentication, including Google Sign-In, ensuring secure access.
    *   **External APIs:**
        *   OpenAI API (GPT-4o) for processing and generating insights.
        *   Deepgram API for converting voice input into text.
*   **Design Patterns:**
    *   The backend uses a combination of RESTful API principles for external communication and modular service
        architectures for internal processing.
    *   Each service handles its own logic and interacts with others via well-defined APIs, making the overall structure
        resilient and easily expandable.

## 2. Database Management

Braindump leverages modern, cloud-based database management for reliability and ease of scaling:

*   **Database Technology:**
    *   **Supabase:** Utilized for both SQL database (PostgreSQL) services and cloud storage needs.
*   **Data Storage & Access:**
    *   Structured journal entries, user credentials, task items, and integration settings are stored in PostgreSQL.
        NoSQL features may be employed for caching or storing session data if necessary.
    *   Data is organized in tables that enable fast querying and support the application's transactional needs.
*   **Management Practices:**
    *   Regular backups, indexing of key fields, and data validation are implemented to ensure data integrity.
    *   The system also employs automated scaling practices provided by the cloud service provider to meet demand.

## 3. Database Schema

The database schema, designed using PostgreSQL within Supabase, can be described in plain language as follows:

*   **Users Table:** Contains user identifiers, authentication details, and basic profile information. It integrates with
    Clerk Auth for secure sign-in information.
*   **Journal Entries Table:** Stores individual journal entries including text, timestamps, voice-to-text transcripts,
    and reference to the user that created the entry.
*   **Insights and To-Dos Table:** Contains AI-generated insights and actionable to-dos linked to the corresponding
    journal entries. Also includes fields for manual edits, status tracking, and timestamps.
*   **Integrations Table:** Manages the connections with third-party services like Google Calendar, Trello, Asana, Google
    Drive, Dropbox, and Outlook. It stores tokens, sync settings, and status of each integration.
*   **Focus Mode Sessions Table:** Holds details about customizable sessions including timer settings, break periods, and
    session status.

For those who prefer a SQL view, a simplified PostgreSQL schema is as follows:

USERS:

*   id (Primary Key)
*   email
*   name
*   created_at

JOURNAL_ENTRIES:

*   id (Primary Key)
*   user_id (Foreign Key referencing USERS)
*   content (text input and/or transcribed voice input)
*   created_at

INSIGHTS_TODOS:

*   id (Primary Key)
*   journal_entry_id (Foreign Key referencing JOURNAL_ENTRIES)
*   insights
*   todos
*   edited (boolean indicating manual changes)
*   created_at

INTEGRATIONS:

*   id (Primary Key)
*   user_id (Foreign Key referencing USERS)
*   service_name
*   access_token
*   sync_settings
*   created_at

FOCUS_MODE_SESSIONS:

*   id (Primary Key)
*   user_id (Foreign Key referencing USERS)
*   start_time
*   end_time
*   timer_settings
*   session_status

## 4. API Design and Endpoints

Braindump's backend provides a range of RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend
services:

*   **API Design:**
    *   The APIs are designed in a RESTful manner ensuring clear endpoints, predictable behaviors, and scalability.
    *   Consistent use of HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for operations.
    *   Incorporates error handling and fallback mechanisms to manage external API rate limits and outages.
*   **Key Endpoints:**
    *   **Authentication Endpoints:** Managed through Clerk Auth for user registration and sign-in (Google Sign-In).
    *   **Journal Endpoints:** Endpoints to create, update, and retrieve journal entries. These workflows also integrate
        with Deepgram API for voice-to-text processing.
    *   **AI Processing Endpoints:** Endpoints that trigger OpenAI API calls to generate insights and actionable to-dos
        based on user entries, ensuring minimal delay in processing.
    *   **Integrations Endpoints:** Manage third-party integrations (Google Calendar, Trello, etc.). Endpoints include
        those for syncing calendar events, tasks, and file storage.
    *   **Focus Mode Endpoints:** Endpoints to initiate, update, and track customizable focus sessions, including timer
        settings.

## 5. Hosting Solutions

The hosting environment for Braindump is cloud-based, ensuring high availability, scalability, and cost effectiveness:

*   **Cloud Provider:** The backend is hosted on platforms provided by modern cloud providers such as Supabase and
    complementary services from providers like Vercel (for frontend) where applicable.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Reliability:** Cloud infrastructure reduces downtime and allows auto-recovery from failures.
    *   **Scalability:** Resources can be scaled according to demand automatically.
    *   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Pay-as-you-go models help manage operational costs efficiently.

## 6. Infrastructure Components

The architecture is further enhanced by several infrastructure components that work together to ensure performance and a
smooth user experience:

*   **Load Balancers:** Distribute incoming traffic evenly, maintaining optimal response times even during high load
    periods.
*   **Caching Mechanisms:** Use caching (potentially through Supabase's caching layers) to store frequently accessed
    data, which reduces database query load and speeds up response times.
*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Though primarily used on the frontend for delivering static assets, a CDN can
    also offload some backend API requests, improving global access speeds.
*   **Service Mesh & API Gateways:** These may be implemented to manage complex internal communications and secure
    exposure of internal APIs to external services.

## 7. Security Measures

Security is a high priority for Braindump due to the sensitive nature of personal journal entries. Security measures
include:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   User authentication and session management via Clerk Auth with secure, token-based authentication.
    *   Role-based access control ensuring that user data access is properly managed.
*   **Data Encryption:**
    *   Encryption in transit using HTTPS and SSL/TLS protocols.
    *   Encryption at rest through secure database configurations.
*   **API Security:**
    *   Implementation of rate limiting and fallback strategies to handle outages and protect against abuse.
    *   Regular security audits and compliance with data privacy regulations.
*   **Data Privacy:**
    *   Adherence to relevant data privacy laws and best practices in storing and managing personal data.
    *   Secure handling of third-party integration tokens and credentials.

## 8. Monitoring and Maintenance

Continuous monitoring and regular maintenance ensure that the backend remains robust and performs optimally:

*   **Monitoring Tools:**
    *   Utilize cloud provider monitoring dashboards (e.g., Supabase monitoring tools) to track performance metrics.
    *   Integration of external monitoring services such as New Relic or Datadog for detailed insights into API
        performance and server health.
*   **Maintenance Practices:**
    *   Scheduled backups and routine updates to all components ensure continued reliability.
    *   Automated alerts to signal anomalies or API failures, enabling prompt recovery actions.
    *   Regular security patches and database updates based on vulnerability assessments.
